## Summary of Work Accomplished

- Investigated missing `/checkpoint` slash command functionality
- Located global Claude settings configuration at `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Created initial checkpoint file in `.claude/sessions/` directory
- Established proper checkpoint workflow for future sessions
- Incorporated initial checkpoint content into unified session file
- Removed temporary checkpoint file to maintain clean directory structure
- Executed proper `/checkpoint` command workflow as configured

## Key Technical Decisions

- Confirmed that slash commands are configured globally in `~/.claude/settings.json` rather than per-project
- Checkpoint files should be saved with date-based naming convention (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- Sessions directory structure follows `.claude/sessions/` pattern for organization

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `.claude/sessions/checkpoint-2025-07-09_11-47-00.md` - Initial checkpoint attempt
- `.claude/sessions/2025-07-09.md` - Proper checkpoint file following command specification

### Modified

- `.claude/sessions/2025-07-09.md` - Updated with consolidated checkpoint information

## Problems Solved

- Resolved confusion about checkpoint command location (global vs project settings)
- Established proper checkpoint file creation workflow
- Created missing `.claude/sessions/` directory structure

## Lessons Learned

- Claude slash commands are configured globally in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- The checkpoint command has specific formatting requirements defined in its prompt
- Session documentation helps maintain context across Claude interactions

## Next Steps

- Continue using checkpoint command at end of sessions for documentation
- Consider adding project-specific session notes when relevant
- Maintain clean git history with checkpoint commits
