# Salty documentation

Welcome to the Salty documentation! Salty is a security-focused password utility that enables 
secure password derivation and sharing through client-side encryption.

## Documentation structure

This documentation follows the [DiÃ¡taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), organizing content 
into four distinct categories to serve different user needs:

### ðŸŽ“ [Tutorials](./tutorials/)

- [Getting started with Salty](./tutorials/getting-started.md) - Your first steps with secure 
  password derivation
- [Deploying Salty](./tutorials/deploying-salty.md) - Deploy your own Salty instance

### ðŸ”§ [How-to guides](./how-to/)

**Task-oriented** - Practical guides for specific tasks.

- [How to generate secure passwords](./how-to/generate-passwords.md)
- [How to share encrypted payloads](./how-to/share-payloads.md)
- [How to configure security settings](./how-to/configure-security.md)
- [How to set up API authentication](./how-to/setup-api-auth.md)
- [How to monitor with OpenTelemetry](./how-to/monitor-telemetry.md)

## Key features

- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: Server never sees plaintext passwords or keys.
- **Client-side encryption**: All cryptographic operations happen in the browser.
- **Strong cryptography**: AES-GCM-256 with PBKDF2-SHA512 (600,000 iterations).
- **Defense in depth**: Rate limiting, input validation, comprehensive security headers.
- **Multi-language support**: Available in English and Japanese.
- **Open source**: Transparent security implementation.
