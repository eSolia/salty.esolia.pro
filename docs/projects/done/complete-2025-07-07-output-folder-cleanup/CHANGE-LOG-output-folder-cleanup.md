# Output Folder Cleanup - Change Log

**Project**: Output Folder Organization and Standardization
**Completed**: 2025-07-07
**Status**: Complete

## Summary

Cleaned up and standardized the .claude/output folder structure to follow aichaku methodology conventions with proper naming, dates, and documentation.

## Issues Addressed

### Incorrect Dates

- QR code folder marked as June 2025 (planned-202506)
- Phosphor icons folder marked as August 2025 (planned-202508)
- Multiple folders with January 2025 dates that should be July
- Inconsistent date formats (YYYYMM vs YYYY-MM-DD)

### Missing Documentation

- Several completed projects lacking CHANGE-LOG files
- REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY in wrong location
- Generic CHANGE-LOG names not self-contained

### Naming Convention Issues

- Mix of "done-" and "complete-" prefixes
- Inconsistent date formatting
- Not following [status]-YYYY-MM-DD-[name] pattern

### File Renaming for Self-Containment

- All CHANGE-LOG.md files renamed to CHANGE-LOG-[project-name].md
- Ensures files are identifiable when shared independently
- Maintains context when files are emailed or moved

## Final Structure

All folders now follow the standard convention:

- [status]-YYYY-MM-DD-[descriptive-kebab-case-name]/
- Each completed project has a CHANGE-LOG-[project-name].md
- Dates are accurate and consistent
- Documentation is complete and self-contained

## Verification

- All 6 completed projects have proper change logs
- All folder names follow naming convention
- All dates reflect actual completion/creation times
- All change logs are uniquely named
