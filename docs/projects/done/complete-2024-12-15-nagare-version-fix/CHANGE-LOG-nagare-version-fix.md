## Summary

Resolved critical issue where Nagare's release process was overwriting custom exports in version.ts, causing deployment failures.

## Problem Addressed

- Nagare regenerated version.ts during releases, removing custom exports
- Deployments failed with missing export errors (SECURITY_INFO, TECH_SPECS, VersionUtils)
- Manual intervention required after every release

## Solution Implemented

### Approach

- Added post-release script to restore required exports
- Updated documentation for release process

### Technical Changes

- Implemented merge strategy to combine Nagare's generated content with custom exports
- Added validation step to ensure all required exports present

## Files Modified

- Updated release scripts
- Modified nagare.config.ts configuration
- Added custom export preservation logic
- Updated release documentation

## Testing Completed

- Verified release process preserves custom exports
- Tested multiple release scenarios
- Confirmed deployments succeed without manual intervention
- Validated all exports available after release

## Long-term Impact

- Eliminated manual post-release fixes
- Reduced deployment failures
- Improved release automation reliability
- Documented workaround for future reference
