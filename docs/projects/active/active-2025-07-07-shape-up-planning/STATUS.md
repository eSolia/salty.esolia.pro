# Shape Up Planning Status

**Project**: Shape Up Planning Session
**Started**: 2025-07-07
**Status**: In Progress
**Mode**: Planning

## Current Focus

Identifying what features or improvements to shape for the next cycle.

## Potential Areas to Shape

### From Existing Plans

1. **Paste Detection** (planned-2025-07-15-paste-detection)
   - Already has a pitch started
   - Could refine and expand the shaping

### From Recent Work

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Based on recent security documentation updates
   - Could shape additional security features

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Based on aichaku integration
   - Could shape workflow improvements

### From Codebase Analysis

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Memory usage monitoring (SIGUSR2 handler exists)
   - Could shape performance dashboard

5. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Encryption/decryption workflow improvements
   - UI/UX refinements

## Active Shaping

### Expiring URLs Feature

- Created comprehensive pitch for client-side URL expiration
- Uses encrypted envelope approach (message + timestamp)
- No server state required - works with current Deno Deploy EA limitations
- Small batch (2 weeks) implementation
- Refined to clarify implementation across:
  - Salty UI: Expiry selection, JSON wrapping, expiry checking
  - Salty API: Transparent handling (just encrypts the JSON)
  - Database integrations: Can add expiry when building share URLs
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Next Steps

- Review expiring URLs pitch for refinement
- Consider security implications
- Plan implementation approach
