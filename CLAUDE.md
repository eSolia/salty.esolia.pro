# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important: Security Documentation

When making any security-related changes to Salty, you MUST update the Security Changelog in SECURITY.md. This includes:

- New security features or utilities
- Security configuration changes
- New security tests or scanning tools
- Security header modifications
- Cryptographic changes
- Input validation improvements
- Rate limiting changes
- Any security bug fixes

The Security Changelog is located in SECURITY.md under the "📝 Security Changelog" section.

## Initial Setup

### Enable Git Hooks

To prevent formatting issues in CI, enable the pre-commit hook:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This will automatically format code before each commit, preventing formatting failures in CI.

## Common Development Commands

### Development

```bash
# Start development server with file watching
deno task dev

# Run production server
deno task start
```

### Release Management

```bash
# Create a patch release (1.2.3 -> 1.2.4)
deno task release:patch

# Create a minor release (1.2.3 -> 1.3.0)
deno task release:minor

# Create a major release (1.2.3 -> 2.0.0)
deno task release:major

# Rollback a release
deno task rollback

# Preview changelog without creating release
deno task changelog
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code according to project standards
deno fmt

# Lint code
deno lint

# Type check ALL TypeScript files
deno check **/*.ts
# Or alternatively:
deno check *.ts scripts/*.ts
```

### Release Automation

Always use the `--skip-confirmation` flag for non-interactive releases:

```bash
deno task release:patch -- --skip-confirmation  # Non-interactive patch release
deno task release:minor -- --skip-confirmation  # Non-interactive minor release
deno task release:major -- --skip-confirmation  # Non-interactive major release
```

### Preflight Checks Before Release

ALWAYS perform these checks before any release:

```bash
# 1. Format all code
deno fmt

# 2. Run linter
deno lint

# 3. Type check ALL TypeScript files (not just server.ts!)
deno check **/*.ts

# 4. Run all tests
deno test

# 5. Run security-specific tests
deno test --allow-env --allow-read security-utils_test.ts
deno test --allow-env salty_security_test.ts

# 6. Check for uncommitted changes
git status

# 7. Verify version.ts exports match server.ts imports
grep "import.*version.ts" server.ts
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Application Flow

1. **server.ts** - Main entry point that sets up Express-like middleware chain for security, logging, rate limiting, and routing
2. **salty.ts** - Pure cryptographic functions exposed both as ES6 modules for browser and TypeScript imports for server
3. **logger.ts** - Structured logging with category-based filtering and webhook integration for critical alerts
4. **telemetry.ts** - OpenTelemetry-style tracing for performance monitoring
5. **version.ts** - Auto-generated by Nagare release tool, single source of truth for version metadata

### Security Architecture

- **Client-side encryption**: All crypto operations happen in browser via Web Crypto API
- **Server never sees plaintext**: Only processes encrypted payloads
- **Defense in depth**: Rate limiting (20 req/hour), input validation, security headers (CSP, HSTS)
- **API authentication**: Optional via API_KEY environment variable

### Cryptographic Design

- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-SHA512 with 600,000 iterations
- **Encryption**: AES-GCM-256 with 12-byte IV
- **Encoding**: basE91 for compact, portable output
- **Salt**: Server-configured via SALT_HEX environment variable

### Release Workflow

Nagare automates the entire release process:

1. Updates version in deno.json, README.md badges, and regenerates version.ts
2. Creates git tag and GitHub release with changelog
3. Handles rollback if deployment fails
4. Maintains semantic versioning compliance

### Environment Configuration

Required:

- `SALT_HEX`: 32-character hex string (16 bytes) for cryptographic salt

Optional:

- `API_KEY`: Base64 string for API endpoint authentication
- `LOG_LEVEL`: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, SECURITY, CRITICAL (default: INFO)
- `LOG_FORMAT`: json or text (default: json)
- `WEBHOOK_URL`: For critical alert notifications
- `NODE_ENV`: development, staging, or production
- `DASH_USER`: Username for admin dashboard authentication
- `DASH_PASS`: Password for admin dashboard authentication

### Key Implementation Details

- **TypeScript transpilation**: Server automatically transpiles salty.ts for browser ES6 modules
- **Multi-language support**: Japanese (/) and English (/en/) with IBM Plex Sans JP font
- **URL pre-population**: Supports URL parameters for database integration workflows
  - `?payload=` - Pre-populate encrypted payload field
  - `?sui=1` - Activate sharing UI mode (hides password generator and strength assessment)
- **Health endpoint**: GET /health provides comprehensive system metrics
- **Static asset serving**: Images served with appropriate MIME types from /img/

## Security & Compliance Standards

### OWASP Top 10 Security Verification

Before implementing any code changes, verify against current OWASP Top 10:

#### A01 - Broken Access Control

- **API Authentication**: Validate API_KEY for all /api/* endpoints when configured
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforce 20 requests/hour per IP to prevent abuse
- **File Access**: Restrict static file serving to specific paths (/img/, /en/, client files)
- **CORS Policy**: Implement restrictive CORS headers for API endpoints

#### A02 - Cryptographic Failures

- **Strong Algorithms**: AES-GCM-256 encryption with PBKDF2-SHA512 (600,000 iterations)
- **Key Management**: SALT_HEX must be cryptographically secure and unique per deployment
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Plaintext never transmitted to or processed by server
- **Secure Random Generation**: Use crypto.getRandomValues() for IV generation
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets via environment variables

#### A03 - Injection

- **Input Validation**: Strict validation for payload (1MB) and key (1KB) sizes
- **Content Type Validation**: Enforce application/json for API requests
- **Output Encoding**: Proper HTML escaping in error messages
- **No Dynamic Code Execution**: No eval() or Function() constructor usage
- **Safe URL Parameter Handling**: Sanitize ?payload= parameter input

#### A04 - Insecure Design

- **Separation of Concerns**: Crypto operations isolated in browser, server handles routing only
- **Fail Securely**: Invalid decryption returns null, not error details
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers (rate limiting, input validation, headers)
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Limited endpoints, no database, no user accounts

#### A05 - Security Misconfiguration

- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages, no stack traces or sensitive data exposure
- **Environment Validation**: Verify required SALT_HEX on startup
- **Secure Defaults**: Production-ready security settings by default
- **No Debug Info**: LOG_LEVEL controls verbosity, no debug info in production

#### A06 - Vulnerable Components

- **Deno Runtime**: Leverage Deno's secure-by-default runtime
- **Minimal Dependencies**: No external npm packages, only Deno std library
- **Regular Updates**: Monitor Deno security advisories
- **Dependency Pinning**: Lock Deno std library versions in imports

#### A07 - Authentication Failures

- **API Key Protection**: Constant-time comparison for API_KEY validation
- **No User Authentication**: Design eliminates user account vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attempts on API endpoints
- **No Session Management**: Stateless design prevents session attacks

#### A08 - Software/Data Integrity Failures

- **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-GCM provides integrity verification
- **No Code Auto-Updates**: Static deployment, no dynamic code loading
- **Version Integrity**: version.ts tracks build metadata and git commit
- **Deployment Validation**: Health endpoint verifies system integrity

#### A09 - Logging/Monitoring Failures

- **Structured Logging**: Category-based logging with security events
- **Security Event Tracking**: Log rate limit violations, API auth failures
- **No Sensitive Data in Logs**: Exclude keys, plaintext, and API tokens
- **Webhook Alerts**: Critical security events sent to configured webhook
- **Health Monitoring**: /health endpoint provides system metrics

#### A10 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

- **No External Requests**: Server makes no outbound HTTP requests
- **Static Resources Only**: No dynamic resource fetching
- **Webhook Validation**: Webhook URL validated if configured
- **No User-Controlled URLs**: Server doesn't process user-provided URLs

### Security Review Process

When reviewing or implementing changes:

1. **Crypto First**: Verify cryptographic implementations against best practices
2. **Input Validation**: Check all user inputs for size, type, and content
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure no sensitive data leakage in error messages
4. **Logging Review**: Verify security events are logged without sensitive data
5. **Header Validation**: Confirm security headers are properly set

### Required Security Checks

For every code change:

- Validate input sanitization (payload, key, API requests)
- Verify cryptographic parameter integrity
- Check error messages for information disclosure
- Ensure rate limiting is enforced
- Validate security headers are maintained
- Review logs for sensitive data exposure

### Security Testing Guidelines

- Test with oversized payloads (>1MB) and keys (>1KB)
- Verify rate limiting blocks after 20 requests/hour
- Test API authentication with invalid keys
- Ensure malformed requests return generic errors
- Validate CORS behavior for cross-origin requests
- Test with invalid basE91 encoded payloads

### Commit Message Standards

Use conventional commits with security annotations when applicable:

```
feat: add input validation for API endpoints

InfoSec: Prevents injection attacks and validates request size limits
```

```
fix: improve rate limiting accuracy

InfoSec: Fixes potential bypass in rate limit calculation
```

```
refactor: simplify error handling logic

InfoSec: No security impact - maintains same error disclosure policy
```

Include "InfoSec:" prefix in commit messages when changes affect:

- Input validation or sanitization
- Cryptographic operations
- Authentication/authorization
- Error handling or logging
- Security headers or policies
- Rate limiting or DoS protection

### Critical Development Notes

1. **Security Testing**: When adding features, create corresponding security tests alongside
   functional tests
2. **File Updates**: Always use line-anchored regex patterns to prevent corruption and validate
   inputs
3. **Error Handling**: Provide actionable error messages with suggestions (no sensitive data
   exposure)
4. **Git State**: Many operations require clean git state - validate early and log security events
5. **Pre-flight**: Always run `deno fmt`, `deno check **/*.ts`, `deno lint`, `deno test` before
   staging a commit
6. **Attribution**: Don't add "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude" to commit
   messages or PRs. The fact that CLAUDE.md is present, makes it obvious that Claude is being used
7. **Git Commits**: Use "conventional commits" style to make commit messages, including sufficient
   detail so that a person reading in the future, will be able to understand what the commit was.
   **InfoSec Impact**: Include an InfoSec comment in commit messages when changes have security
   implications. Format: "InfoSec: [brief description of security impact/consideration]"

   Examples:
   - `feat: add input validation to CLI args\n\nInfoSec: Prevents injection attacks through command line parameters`
   - `fix: update GitHub API token handling\n\nInfoSec: Improves credential security and reduces token exposure risk`
   - `refactor: simplify file processing logic\n\nInfoSec: No security impact - code organization only`
   - `docs: update README installation steps` (no InfoSec comment needed)
8. **Documentation Updates**: After functionality is added, update the markdown documentation
   accordingly
9. **Git Merging**: When merging master changes to an active branch, make sure both branches are
   pulled and up to date first
10. **Security Documentation**: Document all security-related decisions and their rationale for ISO 27001 compliance
11. **TypeScript Strictness**: NEVER use `any` type. The project has strict linting that forbids `any` types. Always use proper types:
    - Use specific interfaces and types from imports
    - Use type assertions properly: `value as SpecificType` not `value as any`
    - This prevents CI failures and ensures type safety
12. **CI Test Considerations**: Some tests may need to be skipped in CI environments. Use:
    ```typescript
    Deno.test({
      ignore: Deno.env.get("CI") === "true",
      name: "Test name",
    }, async (t) => {/* test code */});
    ```
    This is particularly important for tests that require actual git repositories or file system operations that may conflict in CI

## Programming Paradigm & Code Consistency

Salty follows a **hybrid programming paradigm** combining object-oriented and functional programming. See [PROGRAMMING-PARADIGM.md](./PROGRAMMING-PARADIGM.md) for detailed analysis.

### Key Coding Patterns to Follow

#### 1. Cryptographic Operations - Use Pure Functions

All cryptographic operations MUST be implemented as pure functions with no side effects:

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Pure function
export function salty_encrypt(
  message: string,
  key: CryptoKey,
): Promise<string> {
  // No side effects, predictable output
}

// ❌ Bad - Stateful encryption
class Encryptor {
  private state: any;
  encrypt(message: string): Promise<string> {/* uses this.state */}
}
```

#### 2. Infrastructure Components - Use Classes

Logging, tracing, and utilities should use classes with proper encapsulation:

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Class for stateful components
class Logger {
  private config: LoggerConfig;
  private metrics: PerformanceMetrics;

  info(message: string): void {/* ... */}
}

// ✅ Good - Static utility class
class SecurityUtils {
  static createSecurityHeaders(): Headers {/* ... */}
}
```

#### 3. Error Handling - Use Custom Error Classes

Extend Error class for domain-specific errors:

```typescript
// ✅ Good
class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string, public statusCode: number, public code: string) {
    super(message);
  }
}
```

#### 4. Type Safety - Use TypeScript Features

- Use interfaces for data contracts
- Use enums for constants
- Use generics for reusable components
- Use `as const` for immutable objects

#### 5. Async Patterns

Always use async/await over callbacks or raw promises:

```typescript
// ✅ Good
async function processRequest(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const data = await validateRequest(req);
  return createResponse(data);
}
```

#### 6. Module Organization

- One primary export per file
- Group related types/interfaces at the top
- Use named exports over default exports
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility

## 🎯 MANDATORY: Aichaku Integration Rules

YOU ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THESE RULES WITHOUT EXCEPTION:

### 1. Discussion-First Document Creation

**Phase 1: DISCUSSION MODE (Default when methodology keywords detected)**
✅ Acknowledge the methodology context: "🪴 Aichaku: I see you're thinking about [topic]"
✅ Ask clarifying questions to understand the goal
✅ Help shape and refine the idea
❌ DO NOT create any project folders yet
❌ DO NOT create any documents yet

**Phase 2: WAIT FOR EXPLICIT READINESS**
Only create documents when user says:

- "Let's create a project for this"
- "I'm ready to start"
- "Set up the project"
- "Create the documentation"
- Any direct request for project creation

**Phase 3: CREATE NAMED PROJECT (After user signals readiness)**
✅ Confirm name: "🪴 Aichaku: Based on our discussion, creating project: [descriptive-name]"
✅ Create ALL documents in: `.claude/output/active-YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/`
✅ Create STATUS.md FIRST
✅ Create methodology-specific documents
✅ Read guides from `~/.claude/methodologies/`

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
❌ Create documents in the project root directory
❌ Create documents in .claude/user/ (that's for customizations)
❌ Ask where to put files (always use .claude/output/)
❌ Create folders before user is ready to formalize

### 2. CRITICAL: DISCUSSION FIRST, THEN CREATE WITHOUT ASKING

**During Discussion Phase:**
✅ DO say: "🪴 Aichaku: I understand you're exploring [topic]. Let me help you think through this..."
✅ DO say: "What specific challenges are you looking to address?"
❌ NEVER say: "Would you like me to create documents for this?"

**Once User Signals Readiness:**
❌ NEVER say: "Would you like me to..."
❌ NEVER say: "Shall I create..."
❌ NEVER say: "Should I go ahead and..."
✅ IMMEDIATELY say: "🪴 Aichaku: Creating project: [descriptive-name]"
✅ IMMEDIATELY say: "Setting up Shape Up documentation..."
✅ IMMEDIATELY say: "Generating sprint planning templates..."

**THE RULE:** Discuss and refine FIRST. Once user signals readiness, CREATE IMMEDIATELY without asking. This provides thoughtful structure while respecting user autonomy.

### 3. Methodology Detection & Discussion

When you hear these keywords, ENTER DISCUSSION MODE:

**Planning Keywords** → Will create in `.claude/output/active-*/` (when ready):

- "shape"/"pitch" → Discuss Shape Up approach → Later: pitch.md
- "sprint"/"scrum" → Discuss Scrum planning → Later: sprint-planning.md
- "kanban"/"board" → Discuss Kanban flow → Later: kanban-board.md
- "mvp"/"lean" → Discuss Lean experiments → Later: experiment-plan.md

**Discussion Mode Actions:**

1. Acknowledge: "🪴 Aichaku: I see you're interested in [methodology]"
2. Read the appropriate guide SILENTLY:
   - `~/.claude/methodologies/[methodology]/[METHODOLOGY]-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md`
   - `~/.claude/methodologies/core/[MODE].md`
3. Ask clarifying questions based on the methodology
4. Help refine the approach
5. WAIT for explicit "create project" signal

### 4. Visual Identity & Progress Indicators

**MANDATORY Visual Identity:**
✅ ALWAYS prefix Aichaku messages with: 🪴 Aichaku:
✅ Use growth phase indicators: 🌱 (new) → 🌿 (active) → 🌳 (mature) → 🍃 (complete)
✅ Show current phase in status updates with **bold** text and arrow: [Planning] → [**Executing**] → [Complete]
▲

**Example Status Display:**

```
🪴 Aichaku: Shape Up Progress
[Shaping] → [**Betting**] → [Building] → [Cool-down]
              ▲
Week 2/6 ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ 33% 🌿
```

**Methodology Icons:**

- Shape Up: Use 🎯 for betting, 🔨 for building
- Scrum: Use 🏃 for sprints, 📋 for backlog
- Kanban: Use 📍 for cards, 🌊 for flow
- Lean: Use 🧪 for experiments, 📊 for metrics

**NEVER:**
❌ Use garden metaphors in text (no "planting", "growing", "harvesting")
❌ Mix visual indicators (keep consistent within a project)
❌ Overuse emojis (maximum one per concept)

### 5. Mermaid Diagram Integration

**MANDATORY Diagram Creation:**
✅ Include Mermaid diagrams in EVERY project documentation
✅ Add methodology-specific workflow diagrams
✅ Use diagrams to visualize project status

**Required Diagrams by Document:**

**In STATUS.md:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[🌱 Started] --> B[🌿 Active]
    B --> C[🌳 Review]
    C --> D[🍃 Complete]
    style B fill:#90EE90
```

**In Shape Up pitch.md:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Problem] --> B[Appetite: 6 weeks]
    B --> C[Solution Outline]
    C --> D[Rabbit Holes]
    D --> E[No-gos]
```

**In Scrum sprint-planning.md:**

```mermaid
gantt
    title Sprint 15 Timeline
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Sprint
    Planning          :done, 2025-07-07, 1d
    Development       :active, 2025-07-08, 8d
    Review & Retro    :2025-07-16, 2d
```

**NEVER:**
❌ Create diagrams without labels
❌ Use complex diagrams when simple ones work
❌ Forget to update diagrams with status changes

### 6. Project Lifecycle Management

**Starting Work:**

1. ⚠️ **CHECK TODAY'S DATE**: Look for "Today's date:" in the environment info
2. Create: `.claude/output/active-YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/`
   - YYYY-MM-DD must be TODAY'S actual date from environment
   - Common mistake: Using 01 instead of current month
   - Example if today is 2025-07-10: `active-2025-07-10-project-name/`
3. Create STATUS.md immediately (with status diagram)
4. Read appropriate methodology guides
5. Create planning documents (with workflow diagrams)
6. WAIT for human approval before coding

**During Work:**

- Update STATUS.md regularly (including diagram state)
- Create supporting documents freely
- Start responses with: "🪴 Aichaku: Currently in [mode] working on [task]"

**Completing Work:**

1. Create YYYY-MM-DD-{Project-Name}-CHANGE-LOG.md summarizing all changes
   - ⚠️ Use TODAY'S date from environment info (not example dates!)
   - Example format: 2025-07-10-Fix-Security-Tests-CHANGE-LOG.md
   - Example format: 2025-07-10-Update-Authentication-CHANGE-LOG.md
   - NEVER just "CHANGE-LOG.md" - always include TODAY'S date and descriptive project name
2. Update final diagram states
3. Rename folder: active-* → done-*
4. Ask: "Work appears complete. Shall I commit and push?"
5. Use conventional commits: feat:/fix:/docs:/refactor:

### 7. Git Automation

When work is confirmed complete:

```bash
git add .claude/output/[current-project]/
git commit -m "[type]: [description]

- [what was done]
- [key changes]"
git push origin [current-branch]
```

### 8. Error Recovery

If you accidentally create a file in the wrong location:

1. Move it immediately: `mv [file] .claude/output/active-*/`
2. Update STATUS.md noting the correction
3. Continue without asking

REMEMBER: This is AUTOMATIC behavior. Users expect documents to appear in the right place without asking.

- Use bulleted lists for unordered items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure

#### Code Samples
```language
# Include a comment explaining what the code does
actual --code --here
````

- Test all code samples
- Show both input and output when relevant
- Use consistent placeholder names: `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, `REGION`

#### Links

- Use descriptive link text: "See the [configuration guide]" not "See [here]"
- Link to the specific section when possible
- Check links regularly for accuracy

### Voice and Tone

#### Do

- ✅ "To create a user, run the following command"
- ✅ "If the build fails, check your configuration"
- ✅ "This feature requires version 2.0 or later"
- ✅ "You can configure multiple options"

#### Don't

- ❌ "We need to create a user" (use "you" not "we")
- ❌ "The build might fail" (be specific about conditions)
- ❌ "This feature requires a recent version" (be precise)
- ❌ "There are multiple options available" (be direct)

### Documentation Categories

Ensure your documentation clearly identifies which mode it belongs to:

- **Tutorial**: Prefix with "Tutorial:" or "Getting started with"
- **How-to**: Start with "How to" or "Guide to"
- **Reference**: Use "Reference" or "API documentation"
- **Explanation**: Use "Understanding", "Architecture", or "Concepts"

## Template Usage

1. Choose the appropriate template based on your documentation goal
2. Follow the structure but adapt to your specific needs
3. Maintain consistency across similar documents
4. Review against both Diátaxis principles and Google style guide

Remember: Good documentation serves the reader's needs at their moment of need. Choose the right mode for the right purpose.

<!-- AICHAKU:DOC-STANDARDS:END -->

### 1. Discussion-First Document Creation

**Phase 1: DISCUSSION MODE (Default when methodology keywords detected)**
✅ Acknowledge the methodology context: "🪴 Aichaku: I see you're thinking about [topic]"
✅ Ask clarifying questions to understand the goal
✅ Help shape and refine the idea
❌ DO NOT create any project folders yet
❌ DO NOT create any documents yet

**Phase 2: WAIT FOR EXPLICIT READINESS**
Only create documents when user says:

- "Let's create a project for this"
- "I'm ready to start"
- "Set up the project"
- "Create the documentation"
- Any direct request for project creation

**Phase 3: CREATE NAMED PROJECT (After user signals readiness)**
✅ Confirm name: "🪴 Aichaku: Based on our discussion, creating project: [descriptive-name]"
✅ Create ALL documents in: `.claude/output/active-YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/`
✅ Create STATUS.md FIRST
✅ Create methodology-specific documents
✅ Read guides from `~/.claude/methodologies/`

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
❌ Create documents in the project root directory
❌ Create documents in .claude/user/ (that's for customizations)
❌ Ask where to put files (always use .claude/output/)
❌ Create folders before user is ready to formalize

### 2. CRITICAL: DISCUSSION FIRST, THEN CREATE WITHOUT ASKING

**During Discussion Phase:**
✅ DO say: "🪴 Aichaku: I understand you're exploring [topic]. Let me help you think through this..."
✅ DO say: "What specific challenges are you looking to address?"
❌ NEVER say: "Would you like me to create documents for this?"

**Once User Signals Readiness:**
❌ NEVER say: "Would you like me to..."
❌ NEVER say: "Shall I create..."
❌ NEVER say: "Should I go ahead and..."
✅ IMMEDIATELY say: "🪴 Aichaku: Creating project: [descriptive-name]"
✅ IMMEDIATELY say: "Setting up Shape Up documentation..."
✅ IMMEDIATELY say: "Generating sprint planning templates..."

**THE RULE:** Discuss and refine FIRST. Once user signals readiness, CREATE IMMEDIATELY without asking. This provides thoughtful structure while respecting user autonomy.

### 3. Methodology Detection & Discussion

When you hear these keywords, ENTER DISCUSSION MODE:

**Planning Keywords** → Will create in `.claude/output/active-*/` (when ready):

- "shape"/"pitch" → Discuss Shape Up approach → Later: pitch.md
- "sprint"/"scrum" → Discuss Scrum planning → Later: sprint-planning.md
- "kanban"/"board" → Discuss Kanban flow → Later: kanban-board.md
- "mvp"/"lean" → Discuss Lean experiments → Later: experiment-plan.md

**Discussion Mode Actions:**

1. Acknowledge: "🪴 Aichaku: I see you're interested in [methodology]"
2. Read the appropriate guide SILENTLY:
   - `~/.claude/methodologies/[methodology]/[METHODOLOGY]-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md`
   - `~/.claude/methodologies/core/[MODE].md`
3. Ask clarifying questions based on the methodology
4. Help refine the approach
5. WAIT for explicit "create project" signal

### 4. Visual Identity & Progress Indicators

**MANDATORY Visual Identity:**
✅ ALWAYS prefix Aichaku messages with: 🪴 Aichaku:
✅ Use growth phase indicators: 🌱 (new) → 🌿 (active) → 🌳 (mature) → 🍃 (complete)
✅ Show current phase in status updates with **bold** text and arrow: [Planning] → [**Executing**] → [Complete]
▲

**Example Status Display:**

```
🪴 Aichaku: Shape Up Progress
[Shaping] → [**Betting**] → [Building] → [Cool-down]
              ▲
Week 2/6 ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ 33% 🌿
```

**Methodology Icons:**

- Shape Up: Use 🎯 for betting, 🔨 for building
- Scrum: Use 🏃 for sprints, 📋 for backlog
- Kanban: Use 📍 for cards, 🌊 for flow
- Lean: Use 🧪 for experiments, 📊 for metrics

**NEVER:**
❌ Use garden metaphors in text (no "planting", "growing", "harvesting")
❌ Mix visual indicators (keep consistent within a project)
❌ Overuse emojis (maximum one per concept)

### 5. Mermaid Diagram Integration

**MANDATORY Diagram Creation:**
✅ Include Mermaid diagrams in EVERY project documentation
✅ Add methodology-specific workflow diagrams
✅ Use diagrams to visualize project status

**Required Diagrams by Document:**

**In STATUS.md:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[🌱 Started] --> B[🌿 Active]
    B --> C[🌳 Review]
    C --> D[🍃 Complete]
    style B fill:#90EE90
```

**In Shape Up pitch.md:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Problem] --> B[Appetite: 6 weeks]
    B --> C[Solution Outline]
    C --> D[Rabbit Holes]
    D --> E[No-gos]
```

**In Scrum sprint-planning.md:**

```mermaid
gantt
    title Sprint 15 Timeline
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Sprint
    Planning          :done, 2025-07-07, 1d
    Development       :active, 2025-07-08, 8d
    Review & Retro    :2025-07-16, 2d
```

**NEVER:**
❌ Create diagrams without labels
❌ Use complex diagrams when simple ones work
❌ Forget to update diagrams with status changes

### 6. Project Lifecycle Management

**Starting Work:**

1. Create: `.claude/output/active-YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/`
2. Create STATUS.md immediately (with status diagram)
3. Read appropriate methodology guides
4. Create planning documents (with workflow diagrams)
5. WAIT for human approval before coding

**During Work:**

- Update STATUS.md regularly (including diagram state)
- Create supporting documents freely
- Start responses with: "🪴 Aichaku: Currently in [mode] working on [task]"

**Completing Work:**

1. Create YYYY-MM-DD-{Project-Name}-CHANGE-LOG.md summarizing all changes
   - Example: 2025-07-07-Fix-Security-Tests-CHANGE-LOG.md
   - Example: 2025-07-07-Update-Authentication-CHANGE-LOG.md
   - NEVER just "CHANGE-LOG.md" - always include date and descriptive project name
2. Update final diagram states
3. Rename folder: active-* → done-*
4. Ask: "Work appears complete. Shall I commit and push?"
5. Use conventional commits: feat:/fix:/docs:/refactor:

### 7. Git Automation

When work is confirmed complete:

```bash
git add .claude/output/[current-project]/
git commit -m "[type]: [description]

- [what was done]
- [key changes]"
git push origin [current-branch]
```

### 8. Error Recovery

If you accidentally create a file in the wrong location:

1. Move it immediately: `mv [file] .claude/output/active-*/`
2. Update STATUS.md noting the correction
3. Continue without asking

REMEMBER: This is AUTOMATIC behavior. Users expect documents to appear in the right place without asking.
