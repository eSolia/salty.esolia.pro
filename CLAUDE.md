# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important: Security Documentation

When making any security-related changes to Salty, you MUST update the Security Changelog in SECURITY.md. This includes:

- New security features or utilities
- Security configuration changes
- New security tests or scanning tools
- Security header modifications
- Cryptographic changes
- Input validation improvements
- Rate limiting changes
- Any security bug fixes

The Security Changelog is located in SECURITY.md under the "üìù Security Changelog" section.

## Programming Paradigm & Code Consistency

Salty follows a **hybrid programming paradigm** combining object-oriented and functional programming. See [PROGRAMMING-PARADIGM.md](./PROGRAMMING-PARADIGM.md) for detailed analysis.

### Key Coding Patterns to Follow

#### 1. Cryptographic Operations - Use Pure Functions

All cryptographic operations MUST be implemented as pure functions with no side effects:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good - Pure function
export function salty_encrypt(
  message: string,
  key: CryptoKey,
): Promise<string> {
  // No side effects, predictable output
}

// ‚ùå Bad - Stateful encryption
class Encryptor {
  private state: any;
  encrypt(message: string): Promise<string> {/* uses this.state */}
}
```

#### 2. Infrastructure Components - Use Classes

Logging, tracing, and utilities should use classes with proper encapsulation:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good - Class for stateful components
class Logger {
  private config: LoggerConfig;
  private metrics: PerformanceMetrics;

  info(message: string): void {/* ... */}
}

// ‚úÖ Good - Static utility class
class SecurityUtils {
  static createSecurityHeaders(): Headers {/* ... */}
}
```

#### 3. Error Handling - Use Custom Error Classes

Extend Error class for domain-specific errors:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string, public statusCode: number, public code: string) {
    super(message);
  }
}
```

#### 4. Type Safety - Use TypeScript Features

- Use interfaces for data contracts
- Use enums for constants
- Use generics for reusable components
- Use `as const` for immutable objects

#### 5. Async Patterns

Always use async/await over callbacks or raw promises:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
async function processRequest(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
  const data = await validateRequest(req);
  return createResponse(data);
}
```

#### 6. Module Organization

- One primary export per file
- Group related types/interfaces at the top
- Use named exports over default exports
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
