# Salty Development Progress Summary

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Deno 2.4 Feature Branch (`feature/deno-2.4-enhancements`)

- **Native OpenTelemetry Integration** (telemetry-native.ts)
  - Drop-in replacement for custom telemetry when OTEL_DENO=1
  - Supports distributed tracing, metrics, and events
  - Maintains API compatibility with existing telemetry

- **SIGUSR2 Low Memory Handler**
  - Detects memory pressure events from Deno runtime
  - Logs critical alerts with memory usage details
  - Cross-platform compatible (gracefully handles Windows)

- **Runtime Coverage Tracking** (coverage-tracker.ts)
  - Tracks endpoint and function execution coverage
  - Integrates with /health endpoint
  - Supports Deno's native --coverage flag

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
  - 28 test suites with 53 test steps - all passing
  - telemetry-native_test.ts
  - coverage-tracker_test.ts
  - server-enhancements_test.ts
  - deno24-integration_test.ts
  - Test summary documentation (DENO24-TEST-SUMMARY.md)

- **Security Fixes**
  - Replaced all console.log statements with proper logger calls
  - Fixed information disclosure vulnerability
  - Updated SECURITY.md with security changelog

### 2. Shareable URL Copy Feature (main branch)

- Added third section after encryption results
- Displays full URL with encoded ciphertext in payload parameter
- Dedicated "Copy URL" button with blue styling
- Works in both Japanese and English versions
- Allows easy sharing via email/chat

### 3. QR Code Feature (main branch)

- Added fourth section after shareable URL
- "Show QR Code" button displays modal with scannable QR code
- QR code encodes the full shareable URL with encrypted payload
- Includes "Save as Image" functionality for downloading QR codes
- Lazy loads QR library only when needed (qrcode-generator)
- Works in both Japanese and English versions
- Perfect for mobile-to-desktop sharing and secure in-person sharing

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Pending)

### 1. Deploy Deno 2.4 Features

**When**: Once Deno Deploy EA supports Deno 2.4

1. Merge `feature/deno-2.4-enhancements` branch to main
2. Deploy with environment variable: `OTEL_DENO=1`
3. Monitor coverage metrics via `/health` endpoint
4. Set up OTLP collector for telemetry data export
5. Configure memory alerts based on SIGUSR2 signals

### 2. Potential Future Enhancements

- Implement paste detection to auto-populate fields
- Add encryption strength indicator
- Support for file encryption/decryption
- Batch encryption mode
- API rate limit dashboard
- Enhanced telemetry dashboards with Grafana
- Memory usage trends and alerting
- Coverage reports integration with CI/CD
- Custom QR code branding options
- QR code analytics (scan tracking)

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Notes

### Environment Variables for Deno 2.4 Features

```bash
# Enable native OpenTelemetry
OTEL_DENO=1

# Enable coverage tracking (optional)
DENO_COVERAGE_DIR=/path/to/coverage

# Existing required variables
SALT_HEX=your-32-char-hex-string
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # or DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL
```

### Running with Deno 2.4 Features Locally

```bash
# With native OpenTelemetry
OTEL_DENO=1 deno run --allow-all server.ts

# With coverage tracking
deno run --allow-all --coverage=coverage_dir server.ts

# View coverage report
deno coverage coverage_dir
```

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

- Main branch: Stable with shareable URL feature
- Feature branch: Ready for deployment once Deno Deploy EA supports 2.4
- All tests passing
- Security scans passing
- Code formatted and linted
