# Security Policy & Compliance

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

Salty is designed with security as the primary focus, implementing defense-in-depth strategies and following industry best practices for cryptographic applications. This document outlines our security measures, compliance status, and responsible disclosure process.

## ‚úÖ OWASP Top 10 Compliance

Salty has been assessed against the OWASP Top 10 (2021) security risks and demonstrates **full compliance** across all categories:

### A01: Broken Access Control ‚úÖ

- **Rate Limiting**: 20 requests/hour per IP address
- **API Authentication**: Optional API key protection with constant-time comparison
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Strict validation of static file paths
- **Access Restrictions**: Limited endpoints with explicit access controls

### A02: Cryptographic Failures ‚úÖ

- **Strong Algorithms**:
  - AES-GCM-256 for encryption
  - PBKDF2-SHA512 with 600,000 iterations for key derivation
  - 12-byte random IV using crypto.getRandomValues()
- **Key Management**:
  - Unique SALT_HEX per deployment
  - No hardcoded secrets
  - Environment variable configuration
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Server never processes plaintext data

### A03: Injection ‚úÖ

- **Input Validation**:
  - Payload size limit: 1MB
  - Key size limit: 1KB
  - Null byte sanitization
- **Content Type Validation**: Enforced application/json for API requests
- **HTML Escaping**: Proper output encoding in client-side code
- **No Dynamic Execution**: No eval() or Function() usage

### A04: Insecure Design ‚úÖ

- **Architecture**: Clean separation between crypto (client) and routing (server)
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Decryption failures return null without exposing details
- **Minimal Attack Surface**:
  - No database
  - No user accounts
  - Limited API endpoints
- **Stateless Design**: No session management vulnerabilities

### A05: Security Misconfiguration ‚úÖ

- **Security Headers**:
  ```
  Content-Security-Policy
  Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  ```
- **Environment Validation**: Required variables checked on startup
- **Error Handling**: Generic messages prevent information disclosure
- **Secure Defaults**: Production-ready configuration out of the box

### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components ‚úÖ

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only Deno standard library
- **No npm Packages**: Reduced supply chain attack surface
- **Deno Runtime**: Secure-by-default with explicit permissions
- **Version Pinning**: All dependencies locked to specific versions

### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures ‚úÖ

- **API Key Protection**: When configured, validated on all API requests
- **No User Authentication**: Design eliminates account-based vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
- **Stateless Architecture**: No session hijacking risks

### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures ‚úÖ

- **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-GCM provides integrity verification
- **Version Tracking**: Git commit hash in version.ts
- **No Auto-Updates**: Static deployment prevents code injection
- **Health Monitoring**: /health endpoint verifies system integrity

### A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures ‚úÖ

- **Structured Logging**:
  - Category-based log levels
  - Security event tracking
  - No sensitive data in logs
- **Monitoring Features**:
  - Webhook alerts for critical events
  - Suspicious activity detection
  - Performance metrics collection
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive request logging with unique IDs

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) ‚úÖ

- **No External Requests**: Server makes no outbound HTTP calls
- **Static Resources Only**: No dynamic resource fetching
- **Webhook Validation**: Optional webhook URL validated if configured
- **No User URLs**: Server doesn't process user-provided URLs

## üîê Cryptographic Specifications

### Encryption

- **Algorithm**: AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Size**: 256-bit
- **IV Size**: 12 bytes (96 bits)
- **Authentication Tag**: 128-bit

### Key Derivation

- **Algorithm**: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)
- **Hash Function**: SHA-512
- **Iterations**: 600,000
- **Salt**: 16 bytes (server-configured)
- **Output**: 256-bit key

### Encoding

- **Format**: basE91
- **Purpose**: Compact, portable representation
- **Implementation**: Fixed bit operations for reliability

### SHA-1 Usage (HIBP Integration Only)

- **Purpose**: Have I Been Pwned API compatibility only
- **Scope**: Limited to password breach checking feature
- **Security Context**: NOT used for cryptographic security
- **Privacy Protection**: Only first 5 characters sent via k-Anonymity
- **Justification**: HIBP API requires SHA-1 for historical breach data compatibility
- **Risk Assessment**: No security impact as SHA-1 is not used for authentication or encryption

## üöÄ Security Features

### Client-Side Encryption

All cryptographic operations occur in the user's browser using the Web Crypto API. The server never has access to:

- Plaintext messages
- Encryption keys
- Decrypted content

### Defense in Depth

Multiple security layers protect the application:

1. **Network Level**: HTTPS enforcement, rate limiting
2. **Application Level**: Input validation, security headers
3. **Cryptographic Level**: Strong algorithms, secure random generation

### Security Monitoring

- Real-time security event tracking
- Suspicious activity detection
- Critical event webhook notifications
- Comprehensive audit logging

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning

Salty employs multiple automated security scanning tools:

1. **GitHub CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis for security vulnerabilities
   - Runs on every push and PR
   - Weekly scheduled scans
   - Covers JavaScript/TypeScript security patterns

2. **Microsoft DevSkim**: Security linter for source code
   - Identifies security anti-patterns
   - Runs on every push and PR
   - Weekly scheduled scans on Tuesdays

3. **Pattern Checker**: Custom security pattern detection
   - Scans for dangerous regex patterns (ReDoS)
   - Detects weak cryptographic usage
   - Identifies potential injection vulnerabilities

4. **Dependency Review**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Runs on every PR
   - Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Enforced for all merges to main

5. **Security Test Suite**: Comprehensive security-focused tests
   - Cryptographic operation validation

### Recommended Testing Procedures

1. **Input Validation Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test oversized payloads
   curl -X POST https://your-domain/api/encrypt \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"payload": "'$(python3 -c "print('A' * 1048577)")'"", "key": "test"}'
   ```

2. **Rate Limiting Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Send 21 requests to trigger rate limit
   for i in {1..21}; do
     curl -X POST https://your-domain/api/encrypt \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"payload": "test", "key": "test"}'
   done
   ```

3. **Security Header Validation**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://your-domain/
   ```
