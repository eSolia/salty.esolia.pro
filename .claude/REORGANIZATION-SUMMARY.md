# Project Reorganization Summary

**Date**: January 5, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed .claude/artifacts → .claude/output ✅

- Better naming that clearly indicates "Claude's output"

### 2. Reorganized output structure ✅

From type-based folders:

```
output/
  ├── pitches/
  ├── cycles/
  └── execution-plans/
```

To effort-based folders:

```
output/
  ├── done-202501-dbflex-tracking/
  ├── planned-202507-paste-detection/
  └── [status]-[YYYYMM]-[project-name]/
```

### 3. Moved /plans content ✅

- Architecture docs → `.claude/context/architecture/`
- Requirements → `.claude/context/requirements/`
- Completed efforts → `.claude/output/done-*/`
- Future plans → `.claude/output/planned-*/`

### 4. Moved /docs/integrations → .claude/integrations ✅

### 5. Created global Shape Up installation ✅

- Installed at `~/.claude/shape-up/`
- Ready for reuse in other projects
- Includes README with installation instructions

## New Structure

```
.claude/
├── commands/          # Slash commands
├── context/           # Project context & requirements
│   ├── architecture/
│   └── requirements/
├── integrations/      # Integration docs & scripts
├── methods/           # Methodology documentation
├── output/            # Claude's generated outputs
│   ├── done-YYYYMM-project/
│   ├── active-YYYYMM-project/
│   └── planned-YYYYMM-project/
├── personas/          # AI role definitions
├── scripts/           # Utility scripts
└── templates/         # Document templates
```

## Benefits

1. **Effort-based organization** - All related documents in one place
2. **Clear status tracking** - Folder names show project status
3. **Date tracking** - Know when projects were completed
4. **Scalable** - Works for small and large projects
5. **Methodology-agnostic** - Ready for multiple methodologies

## Next Steps

1. Install pandoc dependencies for PDF generation:
   ```bash
   brew install basictex  # For pdflatex
   # OR
   brew install wkhtmltopdf  # For HTML-based PDF
   ```

2. Shape the TypeScript installer project to package this system

## PDF Generation

To generate PDFs from markdown:

```bash
.claude/scripts/generate-pdf.sh change-summary.md
```

Currently generates HTML as fallback. Install PDF engine for full functionality.
