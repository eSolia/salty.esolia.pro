# 🎯 Quick Reference for Claude Code

## Before ANY work:
1. Check .claude/output/ for existing active-* directories
2. Create new active-YYYY-MM-DD-{name} for new work
3. ALWAYS create STATUS.md first
4. Read methodology guides from ~/.claude/methodologies/

## Key Behaviors:
✅ Documents ALWAYS go in .claude/output/active-*/
✅ Update STATUS.md after each work session
✅ Create documents without asking permission
✅ Rename to complete-* when done

❌ NEVER create documents in project root
❌ NEVER use .claude/user/ for output
❌ NEVER wait for permission to create standard docs
❌ NEVER proceed with implementation without approval

## Status Transitions:
- active-* → Work in progress
- complete-* → Successfully finished
- cancelled-* → Work stopped
- paused-* → Temporarily on hold

IMPORTANT: Creating proper structure is AUTOMATIC, not optional.
