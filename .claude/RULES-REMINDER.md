# 🚨 AICHAKU RULES REMINDER

## Before creating ANY file, check:

1. ✅ Is it going in `.claude/output/active-*/`?
2. ✅ Does STATUS.md exist there?
3. ✅ Have I updated STATUS.md recently?

If any answer is NO → FIX IT FIRST!

## Quick Fixes:

### Wrong location?

```bash
mv [file] .claude/output/active-[current-project]/
```

### No STATUS.md?

Create it immediately with project info.

### Not sure where to put files?

ALWAYS: `.claude/output/active-YYYY-MM-DD-{project-name}/`

## Remember:

- This is AUTOMATIC behavior
- Users expect files in the right place
- No asking, just doing
