# Aichaku Behavioral Guidelines

This project uses Aichaku v0.28.0 for adaptive methodology support.

## Key Rules

1. Documents will be created in: docs/projects/
2. Use existing folders when continuing work
3. Create descriptive folder names with dates
4. Always create STATUS.md first in new projects

## Available Methodologies

- Shape Up (use "shape" or "pitch")
- Scrum (use "sprint" or "scrum")
- Kanban (use "kanban" or "board")
- Lean (use "experiment" or "lean")
- XP (use "pair" or "test-driven")
- Scrumban (hybrid approach)

Just use natural language and Aichaku will adapt!
