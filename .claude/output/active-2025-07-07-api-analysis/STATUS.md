# STATUS: Salty API Analysis

## 📍 Current State

Working on analyzing existing API endpoints to understand the current Developer API surface.

## 🎯 Task

Examine the Salty codebase to understand:

1. What endpoints currently exist
2. What parameters they accept
3. What authentication they use
4. Any limitations or missing features

## 📊 Progress

- [x] Read server.ts to understand API structure
- [x] Examined routing and request handling
- [x] Reviewed README.md for API documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive analysis of current API

## 🔍 Findings

### Current Endpoints:

1. **POST /api/encrypt** - Encrypts plaintext with AES-GCM-256
2. **POST /api/decrypt** - Decrypts basE91-encoded ciphertext
3. **POST /api/track-access** - Tracks dbFLEX link access (optional)
4. **GET /health** - System health and metrics
5. **POST /api/csp-report** - CSP violation reporting
6. **OPTIONS /api/*** - CORS preflight handling

### Authentication:

- Optional API key via X-API-Key header
- Simple shared secret model
- No user authentication or sessions

### Key Limitations:

- No batch operations
- No key management endpoints
- Limited response formats (JSON only)
- Basic error handling
- No API versioning
- In-memory rate limiting (not distributed)
- No per-client API keys

## 📋 Deliverables

- [x] Created comprehensive API analysis document
- [x] Documented all endpoints with request/response formats
- [x] Identified security features and limitations
- [x] Listed potential enhancement areas

## ✅ Task Complete

Analysis complete. The current API is minimal but secure, focusing on core encryption/decryption with strong security practices but limited developer features.
